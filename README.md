This project focuses on creating two computer programs to help detect breast cancer at an early stage using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
The first program, named deborah_model_v1.py, uses a simple method called logistic regression. 
It's like drawing a straight line to separate the good cells from the bad ones. 
The second program, called deborah_model_v2.py, is a bit more complex.
It uses something called a support vector machine (SVM), which is like drawing a more flexible line to do the same job.
Both programs learn from information about tumors to make guesses if they are cancerous or not. 
We check how accurate their guesses are using some standard tests
